In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regard to the `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` mechanisms.  Consider a scenario where an object is created and then added to an array.  If the array is subsequently released without the object itself being removed or its retain count being manually adjusted, the object may be prematurely deallocated leading to crashes or unexpected behavior. This often happens when an object is added to an array and the array isn't retaining it; the object gets autoreleased and deallocated before the array gets a chance to use it.

```objectivec
NSMutableArray *myArray = [NSMutableArray array];
MyObject *myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
[myArray addObject:myObject];
[myObject release]; // Incorrect - this prematurely releases myObject
```

This is problematic because `addObject` doesn't inherently retain the added object.  The programmer assumes the array will manage the object's lifecycle, but that's not the case, leading to a dangling pointer.
